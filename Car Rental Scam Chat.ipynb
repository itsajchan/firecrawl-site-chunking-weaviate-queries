Fast forward a month later and I have received a £75 fine from them claiming I left the vehicle where it could not be parked, I asked for proof of the ticket, this was sent to me, the ticket was issued the following morning (05:08am)after I had ended my trip, more than 10 miles from where I left the vehicle. Now Zipcar are saying nobody else used the vehicle after me so it’s my fault. How is it possible that nobody used the car but got a ticket more than 10 miles away I have contacted them via phone and email sent them evidence and a screenshot of google maps to show the distance and now they have stopped responding to me. Instead they have removed the trip from the trip section on my account and kept the £75 charge on my account. What can I do?\n",

      "If you're facing a situation where a car rental company is asking you for money, there are several steps you can take to protect yourself. Here are some similar experiences and advice shared by others:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dispute the Charge**: If you believe the charge is unjustified, consider contacting your credit card company to dispute the payment. You can ask them to put a hold on the payment while the dispute is being resolved. This can prevent the rental company from taking money from your account without your consent. \n",
      "\n",
      "   - Example: A user mentioned that they used a card where they only transfer money to avoid unauthorized charges. They were able to prevent the rental company from taking money by not transferring funds to that card. [Read more here](https://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/discussion/6437902/zipcar-false-fine).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Your Insurance**: If you have home insurance, check if it includes legal expenses cover. If it does, you can call the legal helpline provided by your insurer for advice on how to proceed with your dispute against the rental company.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Example: Another user suggested checking for legal expenses cover in your home insurance policy, which can provide you with legal advice and support. [More details here](https://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/discussion/6437902/zipcar-false-fine).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Document Everything**: Keep a record of all communications with the rental company, including emails, phone calls, and any documents related to the rental agreement. This documentation can be crucial if you need to escalate the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Seek Legal Advice**: If the situation escalates and you feel that your rights are being violated, consider seeking legal advice. A lawyer can help you understand your options and the best course of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consumer Protection Agencies**: You can also reach out to consumer protection agencies in your area. They can provide guidance and may be able to intervene on your behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "By taking these steps, you can better protect yourself from unjust charges by a car rental company. If you have any further questions or need more specific advice, feel free to ask!\n",
